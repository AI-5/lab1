			Hello there! My name is Amiel Ivan R. Heramia. You can call me Ivan.
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: helvetica; text-align: justify;">
			I really enjoy immersing myself into a fictional reality by through various media. Because of this, I often spend my free time playing video games, either alone to enjoy the story, or with friends.
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: helvetica; text-align: justify;">
			I'm not really talkative unless I'm already quite familiar with the person and if I think that I have something in common to discuss about so I'm not usually the first person to try to start a conversation.
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: helvetica; text-align: justify;">
			My interest with video games helped me decide on the profession I would like to pursue in the future, and that is to develop video games that people like me would come to appreciate and remember. It's like my way of paying back the video game industry for the fun it gave me.
